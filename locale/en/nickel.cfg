[technology-description]
invar-processing=Invar is an alloy of iron and nickel noted for its ability to maintain its shape under high heat.
valves=Precision machined fluid control components.
injection-molding=Technique to produce plastic parts with complex shapes.
gimbaled-thruster=Rocket engines capable of course corrections.
mechanical-engineering=For bot's sake, tie back your hair.
advanced-flow-controller=More complex fluid control systems for the next generation of machines.
nickel-electromagnet=A strong, modular electromagnet. Useful for making better motors, particle accelerators, and preventing things from floating away in zero-G.

machine-homeostasis=Using passive biochemical negative feedback loops to regulate the valves in chemical plants and similar machines, reducing the need for circuitry. They probably can't suffer.

nitinol-processing=An advanced nickel-titanium alloy with unique thermo-mechanical properties.
space-nitinol-processing=Processing nitinol on an oxygen-rich planet wastes much of the material due to reactions with the atmosphere. Creating it in a vacuum is more efficient.
space-nitinol-processing-helium=Processing nitinol on an oxygen-rich planet wastes much of the material due to reactions with the atmosphere. Creating it in a vacuum or in a non-reactive helium atmosphere is more efficient.
nitinol-mesh-beryllium=Beryllium-framed nitinol mesh is lighter and cheaper.

[mod-setting-name]
ifnickel-steel-valve=Enable steel in valve recipe
ifnickel-experimental-intermediates=Hard Mode
ifnickel-se-maintenance=Enable Space Exploration maintenance recipes

[mod-setting-description]
ifnickel-steel-valve=Adds steel to the recipe for valves, and removes an equivalent amount of steel from many recipes that require valves. Can lead to somewhat iffy recipes but can counteract ingredient-count-bloat with certain mod sets.
ifnickel-experimental-intermediates=Enable numerous extra intermediates: motorized articulators, cooling fans, flow controllers, machining tools, gimbaled thrusters. Advanced flow controllers and electromagnets with Space Exploration. Nitinol plate, nitinol mesh, and self-regulating valves with Space Exploration and BZ Titanium.  Many of these are complex and/or expensive, relative to the vanilla balance.
ifnickel-se-maintenance=If enabled alongside Space Exploration and Hard Mode, hypercoolers/radiators will sometimes need replacement flow controllers, and particle accelerator type buildings will sometimes need replacement electromagnets.
